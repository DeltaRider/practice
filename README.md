# practice2

## steps

1. make a folder on your computer
2. go into that folder
3. git init
4. make a README.md file and put something in it
5. echo "# practice2" >> README.md 
6. git add .
7. git commit -m 'added a readme'
8. make a repository on github
9. git remote add origin "thaturl.git goes here"
10. git push origin master


if you mistakenly add a wrong remote, you can do 
```
git remote -v 
```
to check what remotes we have

and then to remove a remote we do this
```
git remote remove theNameOfTheRemoteGoesHere
```
